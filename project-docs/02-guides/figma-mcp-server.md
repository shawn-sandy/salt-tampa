### 2. MCP Server Integration

The Figma MCP server should be automatically available in Claude Code environments that support MCP protocols. No additional installation is typically required.

## Usage Guide

### Working with Node IDs

Most Figma MCP operations require a `nodeId` parameter. You can obtain node IDs in several ways:

#### From Figma URLs

Extract node IDs from Figma URLs:

```
https://figma.com/design/fileKey/fileName?node-id=1-2
```

The `nodeId` would be `1:2` (replace hyphens with colons)

#### From Figma Desktop

1. Select a component/frame in Figma
2. Right-click and choose "Copy Link"
3. Extract the node ID from the URL

#### Using Selected Nodes

If you don't provide a `nodeId`, the MCP server will use the currently selected node in Figma Desktop.

### Core Functions
