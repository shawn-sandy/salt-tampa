# Completed Work

This directory contains documentation for implementation work that has been successfully completed.

## Purpose

Unlike `archived/`, which contains deprecated or outdated information, `completed/` holds historical records of successful implementations that:

- Are fully implemented and deployed
- May still be referenced for understanding the system
- Provide valuable context for future work
- Document the journey from plan to completion

## What Goes Here

### Implementation Summaries

- Overall implementation completion reports
- Phase completion summaries
- Migration completion records

### Post-Implementation Documentation

- Post-migration checklists
- Verification reports
- Resolution documentation for complex issues

### Completion Criteria

Move implementation documents here when:

- ✅ Implementation is 100% complete
- ✅ All tests are passing
- ✅ Documentation is updated
- ✅ Code is deployed to production
- ✅ No active work remaining on the feature

## Current Contents

### Implementation Records

- [`implementation-summary.md`](./implementation-summary.md) - Overall implementation summary
- [`implementation-complete.md`](./implementation-complete.md) - Completion reports

### Migration Documentation

- [`post-migration-checklist.md`](./post-migration-checklist.md) - Migration verification checklist
- [`phase-1-verification.md`](./phase-1-verification.md) - Phase 1 completion verification
- [`phase-2-migration.md`](./phase-2-migration.md) - Phase 2 migration completion

### Issue Resolutions

- [`role-sync-resolution.md`](./role-sync-resolution.md) - Role synchronization issue resolution
- [`clerk-user-profile-impl.md`](./clerk-user-profile-impl.md) - User profile implementation completion

## Difference from Archives

| Aspect          | Completed/                           | Archived/                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Status**      | Successfully implemented             | Deprecated/outdated       |
| **Value**       | Historical reference, still accurate | Historical context only   |
| **Information** | Current approach                     | Previous approach         |
| **Use Case**    | Understanding how we got here        | Why we changed direction  |
| **Accuracy**    | Still reflects production            | May no longer be accurate |

## Using Completed Documentation

### When to Reference

- Understanding the history of a feature
- Planning related enhancements
- Troubleshooting implementation issues
- Onboarding new team members
- Planning similar migrations

### Best Practices

1. **Check dates** - Note when work was completed
2. **Verify current state** - Code may have evolved since completion
3. **Use for context** - Understand decisions, not necessarily current implementation
4. **Link to active docs** - Point to current documentation for up-to-date information

## Moving Documents to Completed

### From Active Plans

When an implementation plan is complete:

```bash
# Move the plan
git mv project-docs/06-implementation-plans/feature-name.md project-docs/completed/feature-name.md

# Update the implementation plans README
# Update cross-references in other documents
# Commit with descriptive message
```

### Commit Message Template

```
docs: mark [feature-name] implementation as complete

- Feature fully implemented and deployed
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Moved to completed/ for historical reference

Closes #123
```

## Completion Checklist

Before moving a document to `completed/`:

- [ ] Implementation is deployed to production
- [ ] All related tests are passing
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Team has been notified of completion
- [ ] No known bugs or issues remain
- [ ] Related GitHub issues are closed
- [ ] Cross-references have been updated

## Retention Policy

Documents in `completed/` are kept indefinitely as they provide valuable institutional knowledge. They may be moved to `archived/` if:

- The feature is entirely removed from the codebase
- The implementation has been completely replaced
- The information is no longer relevant to understanding the current system
