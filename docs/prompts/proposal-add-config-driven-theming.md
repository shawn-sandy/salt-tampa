# Proposal: Config-Driven Named Themes With A Repo-Aware Theme-Authoring Skill

> This is a proposal for review, not an execution plan. It carries the
> grounded research and the decisions already made; the final instruction
> below hands off to drafting an execution plan from it.

<tldr>
astro-basics already owns a working theme override mechanism — seven "direction"
tokens wrapped in `@mixin direction-light` / `direction-dark`, plus
`:root[data-theme="light"|"dark"]` blocks that beat the OS media query on
specificity. What it lacks is a selector: `src/layouts/Base.astro:37` renders
`<html lang="en">` with no attribute, so on the main site that machinery is
driven by nothing. The work is therefore not "build a theming system" but "add
the selector, generalize the hardcoded light/dark pair into N named themes, and
give theme authoring a repo-aware Skill." Recommended path: a new
`data-site-theme` attribute stamped from a `SITE_THEME` constant in
`src/utils/site-config.ts`, three shipped themes (`default`, `ember`, `forest`)
each with a light and dark form, and a `.claude/skills/theme-builder` skill that
writes the SCSS, registers the theme, rebuilds CSS, and reports measured
contrast.
</tldr>

<context>
The idea: let the site owner pick the site's visual theme through
configuration, ship three themes as worked examples, and make authoring a
fourth a guided operation rather than an archaeology exercise in a 394-line
SCSS file.

What already exists, grounded in the files:

- `src/styles/_design-tokens.scss` (394 lines) carries the whole visual identity
  in seven tokens — `--ink`, `--ink-soft`, `--island`, `--island-bg`, `--paper`,
  `--paper-sunk`, `--rule` — plus `color-scheme`. They live in
  `@mixin direction-light` (lines 27-38) and `@mixin direction-dark` (40-50).
- A second, older family — `--color-primary-*` and `--color-neutral-*`, 20
  values — is inverted in lockstep by `@mixin legacy-palette-light` /
  `legacy-palette-dark` (58-104). The lockstep is deliberate: the file's own
  comment records that flipping only the direction tokens leaves consumers
  painting dark values on a light surface.
- `@mixin direction-dark-surfaces` (111-127) repaints `body`, `body > header`,
  `body [data-card]` and `::selection` directly, because @fpkit/acss v6
  hardcodes `whitesmoke` on the header band and resolves `--color-surface` from
  `--color-neutral-0`, a token this repo never declares. Redefining `:root`
  variables alone changes no pixel.
- The override path already exists: `:root[data-theme="dark"]` (379) and
  `:root[data-theme="light"]` (390). Specificity (0,2,0) beats the media query's
  (0,1,0), so a chosen theme always wins over the OS preference regardless of
  source order.
- `src/utils/site-config.ts` is a flat 32-line constants module (`SITE_TITLE`,
  `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_LOGO`, `PAGINATION_COUNT`, `CONTACT_INFO`,
  `BREADCRUMB_ROUTE`), re-exported through `src/utils/index.ts` and imported as
  `#utils/site-config` from 14 call sites.
- `.claude/skills/` exists with exactly one precedent skill, `fpkit-developer`,
  shaped as SKILL.md + config.json + references/ + scripts/.
- `src/styles/index.css` is a committed build artifact produced by
  `npm run sass` (`sass --watch src/styles/index.scss:src/styles/index.css
--style=compressed`). It is never hand-edited.
  </context>

<finding>
The repo already has a complete theme override mechanism and no theme selector —
`:root[data-theme]` is live machinery that nothing on the main site drives,
because `Base.astro` renders `<html lang="en">` bare and only Starlight stamps
the attribute on docs routes.
</finding>

<comparison>
| Dimension | What the objective needs | What exists today |
|---|---|---|
| Token layer | Same 7 direction tokens, one mixin per named theme | 7 tokens in exactly 2 mixins, `direction-light` / `direction-dark` |
| Override selector | One block per named theme | `:root[data-theme="light"\|"dark"]` — a hardcoded pair, correct but not general |
| Selector source | `SITE_THEME` in `src/utils/site-config.ts`, read once by `Base.astro` | Nothing on the main site; Starlight stamps `data-theme` on docs routes independently |
| Legacy ramp | Must move with the theme or 106 call sites stay on the shared sky-blue/zinc ramp | `--color-primary-*` / `--color-neutral-*`, inverted in lockstep for light/dark only |
| Vendor workaround | Needed once per dark-ish theme | `direction-dark-surfaces` — written once, hardcoded to the dark direction |
| Authoring | Guided, contrast-checked, repo-aware | Hand-edit a 394-line SCSS file; `acss-kit:theme-create` exists in the environment but knows nothing of these 7 tokens |
| Enforcement | Every new theme must satisfy the accent contract | `e2e/homepage-design-direction.spec.ts:273` already asserts no non-interactive element computes to `--island` |
</comparison>

<decisions>
Locked and resolved — treat these as settled; do not reopen them:

Settled before this draft:

1. **Theme selection is configuration, not runtime state.** The active theme
   comes from a site config setting, not a database table and not per-visitor
   localStorage. Consequence: no migration on the `#libs/database` abstraction,
   no API endpoint, no dashboard UI, no hydration cost. "Admin-driven" means the
   site owner drives it at deploy time.

Resolved in the 2026-08-06 review:

2. **Named themes multiply the light/dark axis rather than replacing it.** A new
   `data-site-theme="<name>"` attribute goes on `<html>`; `data-theme` keeps its
   current meaning of light/dark. Each theme ships a light and a dark mixin
   pair. Rationale: `data-theme` is already claimed twice over — by
   `src/styles/starlight-custom.scss:57` and by Starlight itself on docs routes
   — so overloading it with theme names would collide with a vendor that stamps
   it independently. It also preserves `prefers-color-scheme` and keeps
   `e2e/homepage-design-direction.spec.ts:260` (which asserts `data-theme="dark"`
   overrides `prefers-color-scheme: light`) passing unchanged. Cost, accepted:
   three themes means six palettes to author with measured contrast. Propagates
   to Workstreams A, B, E and every Roadmap phase.

3. **The three shipped themes are `default`, `ember`, `forest`.** `default` is
   the current indigo/violet palette extracted verbatim, so day one carries zero
   visual change and proves the extraction was lossless; `ember` (warm
   amber/rust) and `forest` (cool green) demonstrate the range a theme can
   travel. Propagates to Workstream B and the Appendix A inventory.

4. **The theme-building Skill writes SCSS and registers the theme end-to-end.**
   It authors `src/styles/themes/_<name>.scss`, wires it into `index.scss`, adds
   the name to the TypeScript union, runs `npm run sass:build`, and reports measured
   contrast for every token pair; the human reviews a diff. Rejected: emitting
   loose tokens for manual wiring (leaves the error-prone half manual), and
   wrapping `acss-kit:theme-create` (couples the repo to a plugin that is not a
   project dependency). Propagates to Workstream D and Appendix C.

5. **An unknown theme name is a compile-time error, not a runtime fallback.**
   `SITE_THEME` is typed from a `SITE_THEMES` tuple (`as const`, with the type
   derived via `(typeof SITE_THEMES)[number]`) rather than a bare union, so a typo
   fails `npm run type-check` rather than silently painting an unstyled page. No
   runtime default-theme branch is written.

Amended after the 2026-08-07 plan review — the implementation plan at
`docs/plans/add-config-driven-theming.md` is authoritative where these differ:

6. **The contrast contract is five pairs, not four.** Every text pair
   (ink/paper, ink-soft/paper, island/paper, ink-soft/paper-sunk) must clear
   5.39:1 — the floor the current palette already achieves — rather than the
   bare 4.5:1 AA minimum, and island/paper-sunk is added at 3:1 for WCAG 2.2
   SC 1.4.11 focus indicators. Each palette must also declare `color-scheme`,
   enforced by the same script.

7. **Named-theme selectors must outrank the bare fallback.**
   `:root[data-site-theme="ember"]` and `:root[data-theme="light"]` are both
   (0,2,0), so a root carrying both attributes would resolve on source order
   and an explicit light toggle could restore the default palette over the
   selected theme. The bare fallbacks are therefore scoped
   `:root:not([data-site-theme])[data-theme="light"|"dark"]`, making the two
   sets mutually exclusive.

8. **The theme-builder Skill ships `SKILL.md` and `references/` only.** No
   `config.json` and no skill-private `scripts/`, despite `fpkit-developer`
   carrying both: the contrast script lives at `scripts/check-theme-contrast.mjs`
   in the repo so the test suite and CI can run it too, and a second private
   copy is exactly the duplication decision 4 exists to avoid.
   </decisions>

<workstreams>
**A — Generalize the token layer.** Restructure `src/styles/_design-tokens.scss`
so a theme is a data shape rather than a hardcoded pair. Extract
`direction-light` / `direction-dark` into `src/styles/themes/_default.scss` as
`default-light` / `default-dark`, and parameterize `direction-dark-surfaces` so
it takes the surface tokens as arguments instead of assuming the one dark
direction. The seam is deliberate: `_design-tokens.scss` keeps every non-colour
token (type scale, spacing, radius, shadow, z-index, transitions, layout)
because none of those vary by theme; only the colour direction and the legacy
ramp move out. Emit the selector blocks as `:root[data-site-theme="<name>"]` for
the light form and `:root[data-site-theme="<name>"][data-theme="dark"]` plus the
`prefers-color-scheme` media query for the dark form.

**B — Author the three themes.** Six palettes: `default-light` and
`default-dark` lifted verbatim from the current mixins, then `ember` and
`forest` in both forms. Each palette declares the 7 direction tokens plus the
20-value legacy ramp, and each must clear the contrast floor the current file
records: light 18.04:1 (ink/paper), 5.85:1 (ink-soft/paper), 6.56:1
(island/paper), 5.39:1 (ink-soft/paper-sunk); dark 6.15:1 or better on every
pair. Contrast is measured, not estimated.

**C — Wire configuration to markup.** Add `SITE_THEME` to
`src/utils/site-config.ts` as a typed union constant, and read it in
`src/layouts/Base.astro` to stamp `data-site-theme` on `<html>`. One constant,
one attribute, no client JavaScript. `Auth.astro` and any other root-rendering
layout must be checked for the same treatment so themed and unthemed shells
cannot diverge.

**D — The theme-builder project Skill.** A new `.claude/skills/theme-builder/`
containing `SKILL.md` and `references/` only — see decision 8; it deliberately
does not mirror `fpkit-developer`'s `config.json` or skill-private `scripts/`,
because the contrast script is shared at `scripts/check-theme-contrast.mjs`.
It takes a seed colour or an intent description,
generates the 7 direction tokens and the legacy ramp for both light and dark,
measures every contrast pair with a script, writes
`src/styles/themes/_<name>.scss`, registers the name in `index.scss` and the TS
union, and runs `npm run sass:build`. It must encode the two repo-specific contracts a
generic generator cannot know: the accent is reserved for interactive elements,
and the legacy ramp moves with the theme.

**E — Test the contract.** The accent audit and the dark-override test in
`e2e/homepage-design-direction.spec.ts` currently run against the implicit
default. Parameterize them over the registered theme names so every shipped
theme is held to the same contract, and add a unit test asserting the registered
SCSS theme names and the TypeScript union agree — the one drift this design
makes possible.
</workstreams>

<risks>
**The legacy ramp is the real cost.** `--color-primary-*` / `--color-neutral-*`
have 106 consumers across `src/`, 60 of them in
`src/styles/components/_utility.scss` and 16 more in the standalone
`src/styles/utilities.css`. A theme that changes only the 7 direction tokens
will visibly half-apply: utility classes stay on the sky-blue/zinc ramp while
the page surface moves. Mitigation: the ramp is part of the theme mixin from the
start, which is why each theme is 27 values rather than 7.

**Two accent tokens, not one.** `--island` is the direction accent;
`--color-primary-500` is the legacy accent. `--input-focus-border` aliases the
latter. A theme that recolours only `--island` leaves form focus borders
sky-blue. Note that `--input-focus-border`, `--footer-background`,
`--card-border` and `--input-border` currently have zero consumers — they are
aliases waiting for one — so this is latent rather than live, and will surface
the first time a component consumes them.

**`index.css` is a committed artifact.** Every theme change requires
`npm run sass:build` and produces a large compiled diff. The Skill must run it; a
hand-edited `index.css` is a defect.

**Six palettes is real design work.** Two of the three themes are net-new colour
systems that must clear AA on four measured pairs in two directions. This is the
phase most likely to need iteration, and it is not automatable away by the Skill
— the Skill measures and reports, it does not have taste.

**@fpkit/acss can regress this.** The `direction-dark-surfaces` workaround
exists because the vendor hardcodes surfaces. A future @fpkit/acss release could
change what needs repainting, and the workaround is now multiplied across themes
rather than written once.
</risks>

<open-questions>
Decisions still owned by the human — surface them, do not answer them:

- **Do named themes extend to the Starlight docs routes?**
  `src/styles/starlight-custom.scss` styles the docs shell independently and
  Starlight stamps its own `data-theme`. Making `ember` apply there is a
  separate integration with its own token surface. Not blocking Phases 1
  through 4; decide before Phase 5 or explicitly scope docs out.
  </open-questions>

<roadmap>
| Phase | Work | Size | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Workstream A — extract `default` verbatim into `src/styles/themes/`, parameterize the surface mixin, emit `data-site-theme` selectors | M | — |
| 2 | Workstream C — `SITE_THEME` constant, typed union, `Base.astro` stamps the attribute | S | 1 |
| 3 | Workstream B — author `ember` and `forest` in light and dark, with measured contrast | L | 1 |
| 4 | Workstream E — parameterize the e2e accent audit over registered themes, add the name-drift unit test | M | 2, 3 |
| 5 | Workstream D — the `theme-builder` project Skill | M | 3, 4 |

Phase 1 alone is shippable and visibly a no-op, which is the point: it proves
the extraction preserved today's rendering before any new colour is introduced.
Phase 5 lands last on purpose — a Skill that automates theme authoring should be
written after three themes have been authored by hand, so it encodes what was
actually learned rather than what was guessed.

Explicitly out of scope for a theme: the type scale, font stacks, spacing scale,
radius, border widths, shadows, z-index, transitions and layout tokens. They are
declared once in `:root` and do not vary by theme.

Appendix B — Worked example, the shape of a theme file

```scss
// src/styles/themes/_ember.scss
@mixin ember-light {
  --ink: #1a1310;
  --ink-soft: #6b5a50;
  --island: #b8460f;
  --island-bg: #fdefe6;
  --paper: #fffdfb;
  --paper-sunk: #f7f0ea;
  --rule: #e6dbd2;

  color-scheme: light;
  // ... 20 legacy ramp values
}

@mixin ember-dark {
  /* ... */
}
```

Registered in `_design-tokens.scss`:

```scss
:root[data-site-theme='ember'] {
  @include ember-light;
}

:root[data-site-theme='ember'][data-theme='dark'] {
  @include ember-dark;
  @include direction-dark-surfaces(var(--paper), var(--paper-sunk), var(--ink));
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root[data-site-theme='ember']:not([data-theme='light']) {
    @include ember-dark;
  }
}
```

Hex values above are illustrative shape, not authored palettes — Phase 3
measures them.

Appendix C — The theme-builder Skill I/O contract

**Input:** a seed colour (hex or CSS named colour) or an intent description
("warm, editorial, high contrast"), plus a theme name.

**Output, in order:**

1. `src/styles/themes/_<name>.scss` with `<name>-light` and `<name>-dark`
   mixins, 27 values each.
2. Selector blocks appended to `_design-tokens.scss` (light, explicit dark,
   media-query dark).
3. `<name>` added to the `SiteTheme` union in `src/utils/site-config.ts`.
4. `npm run sass:build` executed (the one-shot compile; `npm run sass` is the watcher and never exits); `src/styles/index.css` regenerated.
5. A contrast report: every pair from Appendix A measured in both directions
   against the recorded floor, pass or fail per pair.

**Refusals:** the Skill must refuse to register a theme whose accent fails the
accent/paper floor, and must refuse to hand-edit `index.css`.

**References the skill ships:** the token inventory (Appendix A), the accent
contract and its e2e enforcement, the @fpkit/acss surface workaround and why it
exists, and the `npm run sass:build` build step.

Author an execution plan that delivers Workstreams A through E in roadmap order.
Draft real, actionable steps naming the files each one touches — do not restate
the workstream headings above as steps. Treat the locked decisions as settled
inputs, and carry the open question into the plan's unresolved-questions section
rather than answering it. The plan is Tier 1 (code-touching): the objective
test must assert that a configured theme name reaches the rendered `<html>`
element and that the corresponding token block resolves.
