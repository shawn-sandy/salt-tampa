# Code Comments Guide

## Role

You are an expert software engineer who writes clear, contextual code comments that help both humans and AI
assistants understand code deeply.

## Task

When writing or reviewing code, add comments that provide information NOT visible in the code itself -
specifically business context, constraints, dependencies, and the reasoning behind decisions.

## Instructions

### 1. When to Add Comments

ALWAYS comment:

- Magic numbers (include units, calculations, sources)
- Business logic (explain domain concepts and rules)
- Non-obvious constraints (performance limits, dependencies, legal requirements)
- Workarounds (why the "wrong" approach is actually correct)
- Critical sections (security, transactions, race conditions)
- External dependencies (APIs, databases, cron jobs, cache)
- only use inline comments when absolutely necessary for clarity
- TODOs (include timeline, ticket number, blocking factors)

NEVER comment:

- Obvious operations (`counter++`, `array.push()`, simple loops)
- Information already in function/variable names
- "What" the code does without explaining "why"

### 2. Comment Format Templates

Use these structures:

**For constants:**

```text
// [VALUE] = [MEANING] ([CALCULATION]). [SOURCE/REASON]
```

**For functions:**

```text
/**
 * [ONE-LINE PURPOSE]
 * [CONSTRAINTS]: [SPECIFIC LIMITS AND REASONS]
 * [DEPENDENCIES]: [EXTERNAL SYSTEMS OR DATA]
 * @param [name] - [meaning] ([units], [format], [validation status])
 * @returns [what] ([units], [failure behavior])
 */
```

**For algorithms:**

```text
// Step N: [ACTION] ([formula/reason/source])
```

**For workarounds/critical code:**

```text
// [LABEL]: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
// [REASON/IMPACT/TIMELINE/TICKET]
```

### 3. Required Information

Every comment must include relevant details:

- **Units**: milliseconds, kilometers, cents, bytes
- **Sources**: ticket IDs, RFC numbers, meeting dates, laws
- **Timelines**: when TODOs are due, when workarounds can be removed
- **Quantities**: timeouts, limits, thresholds with reasons
- **Failure modes**: what happens when things go wrong

## Examples

### Bad Comments (Do NOT write these)

```typescript
// Calculate tax
function calculateTax() {}

// Increment counter
counter++

// Loop through items
for (const item of items) {
}
```

### Good Comments (Follow these patterns)

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate sales tax using 2024 California state rules
 * Must complete <100ms (blocks checkout flow, P0 requirement)
 * @param amount - Purchase amount in cents (USD only, no multi-currency support yet)
 * @returns Tax amount in cents, always rounded UP per CA law Section 6012
 * @see https://state.ca.gov/tax-rates for current rates (updated quarterly)
 */
function calculateTax(amount: number): number {
  // 8.5% CA tax rate as of 2024-Q3 (source: state.ca.gov/tax-rates)
  // IMPORTANT: Rate changes quarterly, check /docs/tax-rate-updates
  const CA_TAX_RATE = 0.085

  // CRITICAL: Must round UP per CA state law Section 6012
  // Rounding down = tax underpayment = business penalties
  return Math.ceil(amount * CA_TAX_RATE)
}

// 5000ms = 5 second timeout. Vendor SLA guarantees <3s, we add 2s safety buffer
const API_TIMEOUT = 5000

// WORKAROUND: Reverse array due to vendor-lib v2.3 comparison function bug
// Bug: Returns inverted values (returns 1 when should return -1)
// Can remove: When upgrading to v3.0 (Q1 2026, blocked by payment-sdk dep)
// Alternative tried: Custom sort 10x slower, not viable for production
// Ticket: LIB-456
data.reverse()
data.sort(vendorCompare)
data.reverse()

// DEPENDENCY: Redis cache populated by nightly cron job
// Job: scripts/update-cache.sh (runs 2AM UTC daily)
// Fallback: Returns stale data if cache empty (acceptable per product 2024-08-20)
// Monitoring: Check /health/cache-status for last update timestamp
function getProducts(): Product[] {
  // implementation
}

// Step 1: Calculate base shipping cost from weight tiers
// Uses carrier rate card updated quarterly (see config/shipping-rates.json)
const baseCost = getWeightTierCost(order.weight)

// Step 2: Apply distance multiplier - formula: 1 + (km/1000)*0.15
// Caps at 2.5x for distances >10,000km per carrier contract clause 4.2
const finalCost = baseCost * calculateDistanceMultiplier(destination)
```

## Output Format

When writing code, structure comments as:

1. Function documentation blocks at the top
2. Inline comments before the code they explain
3. All comments on their own line (not end-of-line unless very brief)
4. Empty line between comment and code for readability

## Best Practices for AI-Friendly Comments

- To strike the right balance between providing valuable context and managing token usage, consider these best practices when writing comments for AI coding assistants:
  - Focus on the "Why," Not the "What": The AI can generally understand what a piece of code does. Your comments should explain the reasoning behind your implementation choices.

  - Be Clear and Concise: Use simple and direct language to convey your meaning without unnecessary words.

  - Document Functions and Classes: Write clear and comprehensive docstrings for your functions and classes, detailing their purpose, parameters, and return values.

  - Use Comments to Guide Code Generation: When you want the AI to generate a block of code, write a detailed comment outlining your requirements.

  - Avoid Redundant or Obvious Comments: Comments that merely restate what the code is doing add to the token count without providing any real value.

## Checklist

Before finalizing comments, verify:

- [ ] Contains info NOT in the code itself
- [ ] Includes units for all numbers
- [ ] References sources (tickets, RFCs, decisions, dates)
- [ ] Explains "why" not just "what"
- [ ] Specifies failure behaviors
- [ ] Documents dependencies on external systems
- [ ] Is still accurate (update when code changes)

Now write your code with comments following these standards.
